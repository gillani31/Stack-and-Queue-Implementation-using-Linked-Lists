**Stack and Queue Implementation using Linked Lists**

This repository contains Python implementations of Stack and Queue data structures using Linked Lists. 

**Purpose:**

 To gain hands-on experience with implementing fundamental data structures.
 To reinforce concepts of linked lists, including node creation, traversal, insertion, and deletion.
 To learn about the time complexity of different stack and queue operations.

**How to Run:**

1. Clone this repository: git clone <repository_url>
2. Navigate to the repository directory: cd <repository_name>
3. Run the Python script: python <script_name>.py 

**Data Structures:**

**Stack:**
       Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack. Time complexity: O(1)
       Pop: Removes and returns the top element of the stack. Time complexity: O(1)
       Peek: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it. Time complexity: O(1)
       isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty. Time complexity: O(1)

Queue:
     Enqueue:Adds an element to the rear of the queue. Time complexity: O(1)
     Dequeue: Removes and returns the front element of the queue. Time complexity: O(1)
     Peek: Returns the front element of the queue without removing it. Time complexity: O(1)
     isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty. Time complexity: O(1)

**Note:**

 This implementation uses a singly linked list.
Error handling (e.g., attempting to pop from an empty stack) is included.
